This section describes typical EO downstream tasks used to evaluate GFMs.

=== Pixel-level Task
|===
|Task Name |Description |Metric commonly used
|Semantic segmentation |Semantic segmentation task aims to assign a class label to each pixel in a satellite image. |Jaccard index(IoU), mIoU
|Scene classification |While semantic segmentation task assigns a label to pixel-level, scene classification task focuses on image-level. |Overall accuracy
|Object detection |Object detection task aims to identify and localize discrete specific, such as buildings, vehicles and ships. |
|Change detection |Change detection task identifies differences at pixel-level using time-series images. This task is used for monitoring land use changes and disaster impacts. |Jaccard index(IoU), mIoU
|Regression |Regression tasks estimate continuous variables from satellite imagery, such as biomass, surface temperature, or elevation. |RMSE

// ==== Metrics
// * *IoU*: the ratio between the intersection and the union of predicted and reference regions for each class.
// * *mIoU*: the average IoU across all classes.
// * *Overall accuracy*: the proportion of correctly classified samples over the total number of samples.
// * * F1-score*:
// * *RMSE*: Root Mean Square Error(ISO/IEC CD 4213:2025)

=== Evaluation Process for Pixel-level Task
==== Evaluation Scope
* clarify the objectives of the experiments (ex. score, inference time, robustness across modalities)
* select baseline model

==== Dataset Selection
First, evluator needs to select a dataset or datasets to be used according to the following criteria.
* downstream task
* temporality
* modality

==== Data Preprocessing
Cropping, resizing, normalization, augmentation

==== Model Adaptation
Model adaptation defines how to adjust GFMs to assess its performance on downstream tasks.
* Encoder: freeze / fine-tuning
* Decoder: plug UPerNet / Linear Layer
* Modality handling
* Temporality handling

==== Training & Inference
Hyperparameter setting should be standardized when conmaring performance between models.

==== Evaluating
Assess model performance against the objectives defined in Evaluation Scope section.
