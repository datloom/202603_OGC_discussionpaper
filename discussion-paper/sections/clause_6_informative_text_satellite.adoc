=== GFMs for Satellite Imagery 
=== Datasets, Tasks, Metrics
*Tasks* +
This section describes typical EO downstream tasks used to evaluate GFMs. +
We focu on only pixce-level tasks, not including vision-language tasks such as Caption Generation or Counting.
|===
|Task Name |Description 
|Semantic segmentation |Semantic segmentation task aims to assign a class label to each pixel in a satellite image.
|Scene classification |While semantic segmentation task assigns a label to pixel-level, scene classification task focuses on image-level.
|Object detection |Object detection task aims to identify and localize discrete specific, such as buildings, vehicles and ships.
|Change detection |Change detection task identifies differences at pixel-level using time-series images. This task is used for monitoring land use changes and disaster impacts.
|Regression |Regression tasks estimate continuous variables from satellite imagery, such as biomass, surface temperature, or elevation. 
|===

*Metrics* +
|===
|Metric Name |Description |Task Commonly Used
|Jaccard index(IoU) |the ratio between the intersection and the union of predicted and reference regions for each class. |Semantic segmentatio, Change detection
|mIoU |the average IoU across all classes. |Semantic segmentatio, Change detection
|Overall Accuracy |The proportion of correctly classified samples over the total number of samples. |Scene classification
|RMSE |Root Mean Square Error(ISO/IEC CD 4213:2025) |Regression
|F1-score | |

=== Evaluation Process
*Evaluation Scope* +
* clarify the objectives of the experiments (ex. score, inference time, robustness across modalities)
* select baseline model

*Dataset Selection* +
First, evluator needs to select a dataset or datasets to be used according to the following criteria.
* downstream task
* temporality
* modality

*Data Preprocessing* +
Cropping, resizing, normalization, augmentation

*Model Adaptation* +
Model adaptation defines how to adjust GFMs to assess its performance on downstream tasks.
* Encoder: freeze / fine-tuning
* Decoder: plug UPerNet / Linear Layer
* Modality handling
* Temporality handling

*Training & Inference* +
Hyperparameter setting should be standardized when conmaring performance between models.

*Evaluating* +
Assess model performance against the objectives defined in Evaluation Scope section.
